# Web API Basics

"The API is a way to **automate** error responses..." -- Don Sizemore, extraordinarily talented infrastructure engineer

Ideally, you should feel confident being able to answer the following questions when we are done today:

1. What is the purpose of a web API?
2. What does a web API do? (i.e. how does a web API function?)
3. How you you feed instructions and information to a web API?
4. How can I use the response data returned from an API request?

### Web API basics

These two resources focus a lot on browser/client APIs but do get into discussing how third-party APIs can be used, which is what we are really interested in. 

The MDN page has a good discussion of how APIs work, in general.

### REST APIs

[5 Key Differences between API and REST API](https://restapp.io/blog/5-key-differences-between-api-and-rest-api/#5_Key_Differences_between_API_and_REST_API) - Laurent Mauer

This is a great resource and also has good coverage of HTTP methods and status codes

[REST API Tutorial](https://www.restapitutorial.com/)

Roy Fielding's dissertation gave us the REST API as a software architecture. It is a good resource for understanding the design philosophy that underlies REST APIs.
