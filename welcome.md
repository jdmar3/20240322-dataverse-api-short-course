# Welcome

Tell us a few things about yourself.

1. How do you (or how would you like to) use UNC Dataverse in your work?
2. How do you think understanding the Dataverse API will help with that?
3. What manual web interface task do you think you could automate using the Dataverse API?

We'll compile a list of use cases for the Dataverse API and reflect on these throughout the course.

- Systematic review of API
- Better understanding of DV API as it interacts with other APIs (REDCap, Qualtrics, etc.)
- NCBI API integrations
- CPCRN Data Management
- Tracking federal funding - API literacy
- Data access for analysis
