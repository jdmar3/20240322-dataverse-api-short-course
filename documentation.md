# Documentation

## Focus

After this portion of the workshop, you should be oriented to the Dataverse guides, and particularly the API documentation. Additionally, you should be able to create/find your API token. 

## Useful links

At the time of this workshop, UNC Dataverse is on version 5.9 (and so is our training instance).
As such, we will want to refer to the version of the Dataverse Project guides ([https://guides.dataverse.org](https://guides.dataverse.org)) that corresponds:

https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.9/api/index.html

The training instance we will be using is availalbe at:

https://demo-dataverse.odum.unc.edu

There are a few pieces of documentation we are particularly interested in today:

1. [API Tokens and Authentication](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.9/api/auth.html)
2. [Native API](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.9/api/native-api.html)
3. [Data Access API](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.9/api/dataaccess.html)

Additionally, the general user guide might be a good thing to peruse in the future if you are beginning to use UNC Dataverse to deposit your research data and want to do more work with it in the future:
